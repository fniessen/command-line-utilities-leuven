# The overhead of starting a new process ('file' command) for each file in the
# first command (\;) causes it to be much slower.

# find . -path '*/.git/*' -prune -o -type f -exec file --mime {} \; | grep "charset=utf-16"

# In the second command (+), combining all file arguments into a single
# invocation reduces this overhead, leading to an execution 4x faster:

# Exit with a success or failure code.
