##? Usage: split-log [options] FILE
##?
##? Splits a large log file into smaller files and converts it from UTF-16 to
##? UTF-8 if necessary.
##?
##? Arguments:
##?   FILE                          The log file to split
##?
##? Options:
##?   -h, --help                    display this help and exit
##?   -V, --version                 display version information and exit
