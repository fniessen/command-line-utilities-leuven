Shell extra utilities

* Notes

Why write an entire bash script in functions?

** Usage

docopt for shell - make beautiful CLI with ease
https://github.com/docopt/docopts

(I choose for the "with grep" syntax to have the documentation in the comments,
while avoiding having to source =docopts.sh=.)

** Coding style

  ~function_name~ \\
  ~CONSTANT_NAME~
